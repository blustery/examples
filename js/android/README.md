# Appium Javascript Examples for Android Apps
These javascript tests were created for use with the Mocha test framework. So before you can run these you need to install NodeJS, Appium, WD, Chai, Chai-as-promised, and Mocha. You'll also need to launch an Android Virtual Device or hook up a real Android device via USB cable and put it into developer mode.

Once everything is ready, type the following in your command-line to run the test:
`mocha [testname].js`

The script will automatically install its app and run the test cases.
