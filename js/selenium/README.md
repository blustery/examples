# Selenium Javascript Examples for Chrome
These javascript tests were created for use with the Mocha test framework. So before you can run these you need to install NodeJS, Selenium-WebDriver, ChromeDriver, and Mocha.

Once everything is ready, type the following in your command-line to run the test:
`mocha [testname].js`

The script will automatically open Chrome and run the test cases.
