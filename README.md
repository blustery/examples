# Appium Examples
This project is to help provide examples of mobile testing scripts against popular native apps or web apps being used on a mobile device. From our own experience there were some hurdles in learning to use Appium. So we hope to provide these examples as a way to help others get the hang of common test cases.
## Installation
In general, you'll need to install NodeJS and Appium:
NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/download/
Appium - http://appium.io

Before you can run the Javascript tests you'll need to install a few modules:
WD.js - https://github.com/admc/wd
Chai - http://chaijs.com/guide/installation/
Chai As Promised - https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised

You'll also need the Mocha test framework
Mocha - http://mochajs.org/
## Usage
These test scripts are made to run against popular mobile apps or web apps on a mobile device. They're free to use to get familiar with Appium and mobile testing.
## History
So far we're just getting started by adding some example Javascript tests. More to come.
## Credits
The idea to add these is thanks to Roger Campbell.
The Javascript examples are provided by Michael Dunagan.
We hope to add some Pyhton tests soon by Amanda Gonzales.
